# angular-password-generator
 
This project is my implementation of a fairly common Angular app, inspired by one of the projects in the Modern Angular Bootcamp course.

It has the following added features:

- Hand stylized via Angular Material components and theming, and some custom CSS
- Takes unallowed characters into account via regular expression
- Improved logic for efficiency and compatibility with latest Angular version, including improved type checking, and passing of event targets rather than entire events

### [Visit the app here on Github Pages!](https://arami265.github.io/angular-password-generator/) (It can lead you back here)

## TODO:
- Add additional pages for additional generation methods
- Tweak styling
